\begin{abstract}

An 8-puzzle is a tile puzzle which is solved by rearranging tiles via sliding to reach an ordered goal configuration.  We use the A* local search algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle, comparing the behavior and efficiency of two relatively simple heuristic functions in order to evaluate the difference in puzzle generation cost and effective branching factor.
